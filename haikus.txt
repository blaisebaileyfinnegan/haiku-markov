An old pond
A frog jumps in
The sound of water


a beautiful weed
sprouting in the summer sun
happy but alone


Great Japan
where a bird sings
the Lotus Sutra


its  am
I cant think straight and much less
count syllables


bust out PDA
what do I see on the screen
broken LCD


salty blue water
waving to the sandy shore
a roller coaster


A single grain of dust
at the mercy of the wind
the life of a man


the old hand
swats a fly
already gone


Here so late at work
Must not abandon Kevin
Tired unity


Short summer night
A dewdrop
On the back of a hairy caterpillar


do caterpillars
think butterflies beautiful
find your own cocoon


Flowers bloom and die
Wind brings butterflies or snow
A stone wont notice


gamers eyes light up
but alas he soon finds out
theres another stage


House of grass widows
only in the neighborhood
roosters cry the dawn


Worker bees can leave
Even drones can fly away
The Queen is their slave


Evening snow falling
a pair of mandarin ducks
on an ancient lake


corner spider
rest easy my sootbroom
is idle


in a new bucket
the same water
looks so fresh


absorbing the warmth
reflecting the summers light
Chenresig statue


night comes with a chill
the partys over for now
until the next time


Moon behind the clouds
the mother nursing  the twins
in deepest darkness


Lotus leaves in the pond
Ride on water
Rain in June


warm calm summer night
cant see the whole monitor
kittys limp bent paw


roses of pure white
scenting the warm Summer air
a sweet confection


Tunnel through the fog
the dying mans wide open eyes
seek for a icon


Without just one nest
A bird can call the world home
Life is your career


even wild roses
of a downtrodden land
reach enlightenment


looking looking
at the mandarin orange
years first calligraphy


the distant mountain
reflected in his eyes
dragonfly


a hot nights pilgrimage
with song
Zenko Temple


gathering storm clouds
blanket the grey horizon
now walk into them


blue car on the street
didnt see the leaveless twig
tink off the windshield


serving me all day
constantly rubbing my hand
my spiral notebook


Suddenly a light
at the end of the tunnel
the moon in the sky


A hole in the clouds
the sun has  send its light to
a cherry in blossom


tiny crystals melt
shimmering in the Spring sun
Natures transition


so why the plunder
this is our only home
worship the planet


Perhaps time is spent
better when working on
your own web site Ha


Mountain song
wind blows
natures music


My cat queen
motion poet
velvet pads


A mother nursing
heres the white line of life twining
this hearthes


Hanging on the rope
lost among the old clothes
the moons kimono


Sweat pours down my face
Fifty hours and counting
Still more work to do


hunted by the cat
with unparalleled vigor
tiny little ant


Ideas may run out
Then I will have naught to write
String together words


eighteen holes ahead
the ground is covered in leaves
great things are to come


Not the shadow of a ghost
only a pedigree dog
look for its master


skiing down the mountain
cause of the fog I cant see
where the path is smooth


thick rain drops splash down
students scurry with their stuff
as August closes


Two years of mourning
vanish
a playful kitten


hazy tired head
remnants of the night before
summerautumn air


together we sleep
surrounded by things that dont
the campfire keeps watch


sparrow parents too
bring their children
Zenko Temple


if people ask
and dewdrops answer
is the lesson learned


breathing Virgo air
laying sprawled across the bed
night shuts his mind off


Long winter days and nights
Sleepless nights ahead
newborn baby cries


Life is so boring
But one will have to live it
either me or you


Snow rain snow rain snow
I forgot the construction
Buffalo weather


Haiku can be fun
But it can take much work
Like coding java


as autumn descends
one man is unaffected
hes called Mega Man


the old dying tree
doesnt care what the leaves think
they will come again


like a waterfall
the yang breath just pushes on
even in autumn


mens mouths gossip
just like a womans
just shorter words


Walk like a goddess
But remember that my foot
cannot see you there


Bashos DeathDay
the pigeons and sparrows
in their Sunday best


Apple blossom pink
Opening unto the world
Peaceful is the view


Delicate sweet flower
Growing with the wind
Soft summer breeze


do you still feel
birds and squirrels on your limbs
sleeping leaveless tree


flowers in autumn
like a mother too well dressed
for the occasion


awakened again
the first work day of the year
sleeping white kitty


winter morning traffic
on a car window
a girl draws a garden


This twilight moment
hope in the covering of
a persimmon sky


Reading Suzuki
My mind grows hot like the air
All my haikus suck


hot hes on his back
how do I look upside down
little black kitty


morning energy
only early do I strive
Day fades Life drains Sleep


summer is over
but fall has not yet begun
custodial sounds


young soldiers
a field of ripened wheat
bends in autumn wind


preschool
the lower panes
rubbed frost free


christmas lists
slightly to starboard
tree stand compromise


sweaty hand on mouse
for a moment I forget
Im not a cleric


when will it become
a crickets nest
my white hair


warrior kneeling
just ten paces from the king
candles see the truth


halfinch piece of chalk
sitting unused in the tray
never used again


a snake curls around
the sound of its hiss
high mountain meadow


A new love story
laid on the widows shoulders
wispy brides veil


Alone here I type
Rapbot lives glorious now
Spits mad crazy shit


Dancing in the trees
Two primates argue over
Green Destiny sword


Spring departs
Birds cry
Fishes eyes are filled with tears


Ouch Pinch from below
Toothy black furry creature
thinks not of my size


laughing bouncy ball
shines bright across the playground
rain clouds disappear


unaware the tree
is destined for the axe
nest building


i am just a man
a simple and humble man
a man of colors


a student arrives
early like the rest of us
air conditioned room


Ruler of the Mac
I think not foolish old man
For I have admin privs


an acorn
striking the roof
squirrel chatter


ghost of the flame
wreathing around
the now cool wick


They pronounced me dead
even though I dance and sing
I am Poetry


Deep in my own thoughts
girl blocks my way off the bus
Bump out of my way


sometimes when youre mad
people start to seem smaller
the eyes of the Hulk


window drips grey light
frowning children walk to school
early autumn day


light rain starts to fall
this halfalive summer day
left ear all plugged up


Some want it snow white
Others want it to be pitch black
Why not make it gray


opening my hand
i return the moth
to  the  darkness


A glowworm affixed
on the clowns red shovelnose
the moons glowing light


Majestic dragons
Spread their incandescent wings
And soar through dark skies


Buffalo Denver
and yet were the same people
life goes on I guess


our ceremony
just a lot of noise
to the cuckoo


cascading water
free fall in many degrees
a fragrant shower


empty pizza box
sitting next to garbage bins
the vacations end


the rain then the wind
and where the leaves had been
pale dry sillhouettes


look at the sea shore
a refuge for the seashells
I love the colors


I can not believe
That the damn gnome does not know
What is a sobe


Items from our work
are the subject of many
poems on this here site


Through the mall I run
Firing off my Machine gun
People think Im nuts


Snowstorm in the field
from the fear over the long night
my hair become white


Only a lonely song
in the emptiness of night
the crunch of the snow


To feel Nothingness
in evening when the nightingale
became dumb


The snow is falling
Blanketing the ground in white
Will it ever stop


ALL YOUR BASE ARE BE
LONG TO US YOU ARE ON THE
WAY TO DESTRUCTION


A stray cat
excreting
in the winter garden


A autumn wind
More white
Than the rocks in the rocky mountain


the beautiful girl
danced with elegance and grace
it is living art


amazing nature
summer through a pane glass door
cats at stairs bottom


mighty hurricane
doesnt care its a school day
violent summer


Can not I vote more
I click once and it goes up
Yet more do nothing


Empty the water
But do not set off alarm
Or the police come


bottle of Purell
brings memories of summer
chilly air tonight


at the four way stop
our insistent politeness
annoys each other


underground river
blind albino ducks
bob on black ripples


After the northe wind
broken in the same drama
lie people and tree


Leaving the graveyard
tens of coffins at the gate
waiting for custom


Show in the open air
some nightingales arias
supporting the sky


the bare maple tree
never would she guess in death
shell be a table


Listen to the sound
poised on a tender rose
the warmth of my tears


For one day
Smile
and mean it


yummy yummy cake
chocolate cake is superb
now it is all gone


Its burning like fire
Its burning inside of me
I cant control it


Only trust in Death
Dreams often make fools of us
Reality Kills


Lazy Saturdays
Always avoiding showers
Ill clean up Sunday


Winter snow falling
Houses covered in white fluff
Fireplaces glow at night


Winter and Spring
Summer with sunlight once again
silver Autumn moon


weblogs can be fun
however with no update
they do get old fast


As I sit zazen
the soul of Jack Kerouac
sits down beside me


Buddha and Christ meet
on a cloud high in heaven
both needing a rest


Can you fall in love
With one look into their eyes
Answers will appear


one day its too cool
the next day its far too hot
miss California


Come spring
Come old man
the pigeon coos


The air shimmers
Whitish flight
Of an unknown insect


Being awake
He says he is already asleep
Autumn chilly night


Ive nothing to do
my hand lives to please you all
Eyes of a kitty


Doom on one machine
haikus on the other one
lunch break in summer


rain stifles the heat
two more days til classes start
the cats will miss me


a man without love
is a man without a soul
a man without hope


worship a woman
she bares the seeds of all life
love her forever


grey noon
a lone seagull
flying inland


The door covered
by shade of mulberry tree
Do I open it


Way of traveller
a chicory field reaches
the horizon line


Stars up in the sky
next to me on the grassland
just a firefly


Sun is burning now
burning here and burning there
do you feel the warmth


I dont understand
I cant reason with it
And I never will


when he stops thinking
hes still breathing in and out
Spring sun melts the snow


Blankets of white snow
become waves of bold heat
as seasons grow old


the earth is shaking
water is rushing ashore
there is nothing left


smile hides everyhting
its deep and shallow
it can kill someone


The sun bright
Scorched the moon
Away


Run quiet and Swift
Evil senses noise and Haste
Never Stop to Breathe


a halo of mist
comes over the rising sun
an autumn morning


a warm summer night
on my bed I meditate
colors go away


Linux shall rule soon
It will overcome Gates
But now it still grows


A crystal clear night
the pearldiver in the depth
by the naked moon


Solar eclipse
a gaping crowd of people
all watching the sky


Its so much slowly
the shadow of the great temple
on a blade of grass


Grey group is the best
So are the mint and green group
So prize are given


After a big rain
Appear a pretty rainbow
How nice the skies is


Love is lost
Snow falls
Its all the same


As the seasons change
Love is lost
What can be done


I will go on
Alone but not
Friends are with me


Bright moon rises
Dark water shines
Poor mans paradise


the helicopter
hovers above me
M shells destroy


Old woman alone
never creating attachments
life is like a dream


Man who looks into life
Too much
Overlooks it


Silence eternal
A thousand birds beauty
Supressed by mind


Typewriters are great
to press the keys what a joy
the ding of the bell


stripe a golden flash
body cuts between green blades
a tail left writhing


All the butterflies
Flapping their wings inside me
Longing to escape


green moss on the wet roof
springy shimmering soggy
starlings comfy bed


Botton of the heart
even the dust of grave feels
the Homing Pigeon


Cold In the first line
having  as weapon their innocence
the young people


Hot summer
an ant hid
under a leaf


Forever thirsty
some people drinking from my cup
I taste the clinking


Lime trees in blossom
incensing the monastery
Resurrections Day


Light like by day time
the moon happily nestling
in yesterdays snow


awake
before the alarm clock
listening to pigeons cooing


winding road at dusk
the logger slows down
for a deer


The samurais sword
Coated in blood of humans
Samurai fight on


The elegant crane
It seems to drift like a dream
Seems lighter than air


walking through the woods
how it seems so peaceful here
surrounded by life


Sparkling fall leaves
Baby panda takes first steps
Each day is a gift


struggling conger ant
icipating a view more
likely a pastie


Numb useless worthless
Fading to oblivion
Nothingness I breathe


So early for snow
The poeple are unprepared
Disaster follows


as heartbeats hasten
a butterfly emerges
my glee takes flight too


as heartbeats hasten
a butterfly emerges
glee takes flight too


unfortunate words
cant wont shouldnt didnt
the saddest in life


Churches sit empty
their songs of praise now silenced
Time for rocks to sing


Karen waits for me
sitting in her Plainview home
Three months til Im there


i hear the songbird
it is calling to me but
i am deaf to it


Now the wanderers
they follow the lonely path
but they are happy


I am spirit and
I am soul I am wonder
I am your True Self


woodpecker tapping
on the forest glockenspiel
tympanic oak clunk


high up in the air
upon a carpet of grey clouds
the plane leaves a trail


Crabs fallen in love
combing the trees of the moon
waves after waves


Beautiful orchard
I gather the summer past
from the ripe pears


Summer evening
at the window some butterflies
crisscrossing the moon


Full Moon is rising
parishioners pious prayer
without votive light


The feeling ends
I dont know why
Spring returns


My writing flows
As my heart pours
My spirit soars free


Blades clash against blades
Arrows pierce sodden armor
And peace was no more


Darkness envelops
The enemy is unseen
Yet he walks onward


Porcelain toilet
Ice cold beer and a corndog
I dont miss the sand


the rain pouring down
floods his home until he floats
then a bird eats him


the cricket season
boundaries marked    razorwire
round the clubhouse roof


furious mother
dressed only in a towel
giggling from the woods


looking through the glass
you can see the sun rise up
to greet a new day


Leaves waving
Summer breezes Autumn gales
Goodbye Leaves


Warm day spaced head
everyone is talking strange
pollen fills my skull


Why are they afraid
of that little spiders web
broken easily


The World spends millions
on ways to entertain us
while we sit and starve


white clover
moth lands
stalk bends


No mistaking it
i must step on the fallen
to follow my dream


Only a ladybird
on a leaf in the sun
the gardians park


A straw is burning
over there after our death
we shall meet again


A single snowdrop is
rising in the furtive way
this snowwhite triumph


After the sunset
the field filled up to sky
Chockfull of crickets


Under the burden
of its own heavy color
dahlia in bloom


not to die guilty
fallen soldiers overlook
old men in afghans


Back into the fog
Amidst the redwood oak trees
This meditation


in a borrowed coat
he has new letters
after his name    widower


My brain is a box
full of small seagull feathers
ask me a question


The Dalai Lama
chants my mind into a dream
OM can clear my thoughts


wake up one morning
note on the bedside table
my girlfriend is gone


cloudy summer day
the bees are buzzing loudly
a hammock beckons


My Chinese sister
is more beautiful than jade
caught in a sunbeam


Green frog in the road
cant decide its direction
Look at the dead frog


Turn on your TV
Watch a reality show
where no one is real


your kiss
and chocolate
my addictions


Nature is a girl
An extremely pretty girl
Shes really liked


Porcelain toilet
Icecold beer and a corndog
I dont miss the sand


I called to the wind
Whos there whoever it was
Still knocks at my gate


Peace Eternity Freedom Love Banana       Hilarious

Orange morning moon
hangs above neighbours roof top
I fall back to sleep


Black woodburning stove
Keeps me warm on a cold night
Thank you to the tree


Dreaming in the night
I awake thinking of you
Echoes from my soul


Blackberries shrivel
Spider webs stick in hair
Fruit flies annoy me


dead grey cement chunk
crumbled from the haha wall
whitewashed by swallows


bent leafy arrow
of Ilkley bracken fallen
among picnickers


solitary dream
wandering over the hill
a poor traveller


Against the mountains
Peaks and troughs of turmoiled sea
Lay flat before me


The summer shade shifts
In a momentary time
Of June and quiet


Russian mobsters
brooding over
chessboards


building now rubble
Bruce Banner
got angry


Im a grain of dust
in the mercy of the wind
my single eternite


Octobers blood moon
internal tides ebb and flow
the world is in flux


Like a winter dream
Kittens jump in snowflakes
Lookmother now smiles


Mountain Path leads there
But somehow I got stuck here
Along the wrong path


Sirius shining
I see her through the window
Eight light years away


We did a bootsale
It was the first one this year
People like seagulls


My wheels stuck in mud
to break free impossible
please someone help me


incessant dark rains
dismal and monotonous
pushes to dry hills


A little flower
watching the wonderful moon
set into the dawn


the animals sit
making the only loud noise
is raging thunder


Dream fragment in sun
The lightembedded day blue
Rolling off the night


Our dialogue strains
In minutes to the days clock
Nighttime alarmums


Melancholia
And the subtle shift of dusk
Darkly dropping night


A harsh winter wind
comes through my heart strings blowing
into emptiness


Unfathomable
Our empty day of language
And thoughts for the night


hungry sparrows flit
on the empty bird feeder
light snow on the ground


Birds chirping a lot
People singing all the time
Birds are going south


The sun lifts its warmth
Sitting here in emptyness
Falling in the cloud


Get rid of clutter
I find it rests my thinking
The Moon and I Zen


My back gives pain
I learn to loose dignity
to stand is to cry


I write my haiku
by candlelight in my bed
so quiet outside


Where is the Full Moon
hidden by mist and tall trees
vivid in my mind


I dream of a room
it was a makeshift home
I talk to myself


the wonderous moon
sitting on the horizon
waiting for morning


the wind blowing hard
but the leaves make no sound
which guides the spirit


the spirit guides you
through the wonderous forest
the forest of life


the wind is angry
howling with furiousnes
for the days coming


From the warm distance
Of decades in your smile
You appear to me


Tinkling key stroke blues
Washed out in fleets of summer
The gray Sunday float


Identity shouts
Through a forest fog of language
Selfaffirmation


Disillusionment
Shadowed up in the new year
Fragmentary blues


Murky mess of thought
Twitching in the unconscious
Submerged energy


Chance encounters lie
Dormant in the daily air
Times foggy grayness


Traveling home now
Through the graybacked wash of day
Rain on the highway


A purple cherry tree
Points west to the rounded hills
East wind in summer


In luminous night
Familiar moon reflects
On the unknown sea


Above the ripple
and squall of deep troubled sea
Glides a flying fish


Field of grass and weed
Beautiful beyond the wire
Only beside trees


Full of pink and gray
Still leafless from the winter
Galahs in the oak


Jealous fits the rage
Of daylight sour time saved
For the winking night


pink tissue floating
in a white toilet bowl
spring


The bees are buzzing
Beautiful flowers are here
The flowers smell good


the season of love
snow blankets the mountain side
i stare with full heart


Delicate lacy
Butterfly gently touches
Silently away


Keep out sign on path
flowers steadily spreading
never learned to read


Pretty Purple rose
along the water coast line
With a sweet smell occurs


Heavy wind and rain
The drop of watery time
On a windowpane


broken line of geese
high in the gray autumn sky
fly on despite loss


splashing home from school
in yellow raincoats children
laugh under dark skies


Frozen blowing white
And all our plunging lifetimes
Twitch in winter cold


Separate words fall
Down gray days of rainy past
And fragmented thought


leaf rides sutumn stream
trout regrets its slow passing
hungry wait til spring


clouds sit still above
mountains stir a placid sea
natures beauty glows


a murder of crows
sit on a rickety fence
waiting for something


two girls sitting in
the park ignore the light rain
zen meditation


moon over the snow
do the dogs scare the coyotes
or coyotes the dogs


Days the hours make
In seconds to our prompting
Haphazard moment


Shadowy distance
The hectoring hurt of day
In a flat echo


Broken glass and all
I wait behind the mirror
For a tweek of sun


Realization
Times accidental moments
My limitations


Frozen blowing white
And all our plunging lifetimes
Twitch in winter cold


sunrise gray to white
midday black limbs shadow snow
sundown blue returns


Ordinary talk
The squirm of conversation
Nothing much is said


Opportunities
Diminished in passing time
Our lost narrow years


Unpredictable
The chaos of streaming years
In a moments time


twentyfive small jade
buddhas sit in the window
waiting to be bought


winter aproaches
working years are finishing
spring will not return


Yellow jelly beans
yum yum yum
so much lemony flavor


Water drips down
from pans own hand
as it rains upon us


Phantom flame
a warm wicker
beauty of the dark night


Mass marketing
subliminal messages
what has the media come to


Armor clad samurai
win back honor
plunge tanto into chest


Men walk down the moonlit path
kimonos dangling
like pagan gods




can u read this


The sun is very bright
While we sit there in the light
The sun is setting


hi peoples gay ha
hahahahahahaha
hehehehehe


cold morning sun
thin frost
on a sparrows wing


warped by fire
the wheelie bin carcase
still smoulders


The day cracks laughter
In fragmented finite time
Our shifting moments


Daytime fit of rage
In a flat failing moment
Cubicle tantrum


Enigmatic you
Treading the elusive day
Away from me now


Common mystery
The thrust of hidden meanings
I dont understand


The day cracks laughter
In fragmented finite time
And shifting moments


Shadowy distance
The hectoring hurt of day
In a flat echo


Dream fragment in sun
The lightembedded day blue
Rolling off the night


Dissatisfaction
The yawning stretch of worktime
In afternoon space


neighbor shot my dog
claimed he killed all his chickens
today they came back


snows force elk downhill
farmer drives elk to mountain
no place left to starve


small tree by big house
days weeks months seasons and years
small house by big tree


pheasant regal on drifts
strutting he oversees all
sometimes he breaks through


to him beautiful
lived loved cared raised family
she forgets his name


Inexplicable
All the sensory data
Of a brief lifetime


Blood pours from mouth
the undead is back
rise of a vampire


The water stands still
as the wind flows over the hill
then again were camping


Pearl light on cold shore
Lights up the indigo sand
I can see my way home


everyone is talk
ing and we need to stop to
pass this class today


Time comes in trial
Steeps of meandering thought
Fractal memories


Morning ritual
The days greeting between us
No intimacy


Melancholia
And the subtle shift of dusk
Darkly dropping night


Identity shouts
Through a forest fog of language
Murky mess of thought


The summer shade shifts
In a momentary time
Of June and quiet


Vending machines
so many snacks
so much diversity


Bullet fly high
out of long tubes
like birds of lead


The ugly old crone
the poet prodigy
and the dreamer unite


Golden sun
pitch black moon
the gods of day and night


Feels so good
let it all out
bad day on potty


Dragonfly
crystal eyes
flutter in the sky


The snake awakens
As a cry cuts through the night
From a far off prey


Hunting a monkey
In the forest with my bro
So crazy o so crazy


Spinning twirling leaves
Moving around the tall trees
Fall leaves winter comes


Summer time to play
Basketball soccer baseball
What do you say chief


a breeze of winter
the wind on my face is nice
I smell the flowers


monkeys swing through trees
thowing bananas at him
hit on the head dead


Sleeping beaver smells
Bad very bad it kills humans
Dead guys smell bad too


Bow moves so fast
Through trees and through the leaves
Hitting the target


the sun is bright today
moring due glimers on the tall grass
for it is still morning


sun is shinning bright
morning due on the tall grass
for it is still morn


milk milk lemonade
In the ocean fish living
they are so happy


The breeze in the trees
fast and cool when it hits me
makes me shake my knees


The summers day comes
Like a bundle of roses
Floating on a pond


the sun is so bright
shinning on the ground this morn
its so beautiful


the sun is yellow
the grass is very bright green
and is very clean


water could be deep
the water may be vicious
yet it stops the heat


The nature calls me
There is something dangerous
I should not be scared


I sit on a boat
Something wow catches my eye
Wondering what the


Little birds fly far
But big birds fly close to us
The birds go away


Summer brings the sun
How we wish winter was done
But fall is so fun


Fish swim under lake
Yum yum delicious fish bake
Now in my stomach

hobos are really
on Mondays and Tuesdays they
are with a guitar


Cody wants to be
a hobo during school days
he will break your fall


People are trying
to go to the bath
room and they wont go


wind is strong tonight
large wildfires could start tonight
turn up the tv


sleep beckons
the far grey country
beyond clouds


Email flashes up
Sullen workload increases
Endless lines and lines


Our dialogue strains
In minutes to the days clock
Smiling alarums


From the warm distance
Of decades in your smile
A winking nights dream


Tinkling key stroke blues
Washed out in fleets of summer
The gray Sunday float


The days and hours fall
In drops of watery time
Morning finitude


Greedy man
steal steal steal
mad with power


Last battle of a long war
the one that decides it all
the thrill of the fight


Man in white robe
hung on lowercase t
my first look at Christianity


Im da bomb
da samuri pirat
communicating with urban hipsters


Something not spoken
Taboos are not to be told
Make no exceptions


summer is so fun
summer you can laugh and play
summer is the best


spring will never come
it is always snow snow snow
snow please go away


The hobo frets fast
In a desert very vast
Then he burst in flames


Wind whistling hard
Through the trees waking my dreams
Turn over to sleep


Light is shining bright
Glowing like stars in the sky
Oh my It is night


Earth Wind Water Fire
These can all be a desire
Only one can win


We need to end school
It has gone on for so long
It is summer time


I hate the winter
Its way too cold and windy
Spring and fall are best


I am like nature
I can roar like a liger
I will be very scary


The hobo frets fast
In a desertvery vast
Then he burst in flames


yo wut iz haiku
iz it sumtin dat you do
well wat do you do


The clouds are high sky
Up there in the bright sky
The clouds are fading


Glisten in the sky
The stars like bright topazes
Mesmerize the trees


Hobos are stupid
They often live in box cars
Nobody likes them


Good morning Aaron
You are quite insensible
You make bad haiku


Hobos are quite soft
So abundant on playgrounds
They can break your fall


Bronwyn is a freak
Hee Hee Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Freaky Bronwyn Help


Cameron is weird
He thinks he is a BASHO
Hee Hee Ha Ha Ha


meg is smelly poo
she smells like whiffy blue cheese
smelly meggy smells


Brenzo is a bum
She smells like an old cheesepuff
Noone likes bronwyn


brenzo is stinkey
bronwyn is a cheesepuff too
brenzo is stinky


haiku addiction
paper scraps easy prey
intent poised pen waits


Wording of haiku
Poetry without substance
Catches on the air


cold pebbles
sensations on skin
warmly now


Lonely night
Maq fills it nicely
Of warm thoughts


The trees have the mist
Smoke fire two bodies one act
I but have a heart


brown innocent eyes
i shiver when i feel you
still youre far away


without you beside me
all I have is my Fear
that you wont return


A campfire dims
Its flames turn to dark ashes
Only to light again


Mahogany clouds
Racing home as darkness comes
Leaving joy to melt


Autumn a sad dove
Flaps her wings to fly away
I wonder where to


I dream of summer
Lilies and tulips ablaze
I long to saunter


It was raining out
As I looked out the door
Then there was thunder


Cutting down the tree
It is a long way to fall
Deforestation


summer time is fun
so many things to do
lets go have some fun


water is cool
water may be dangeous
yet it stops the heat


I need help
I need a Haiuku poem about the Trojan war as you as a sloider
PLEASE HELP

Nighttime is coming
Go to sleep weary hobo
nest in a boxcar


John Bell Hood is strange
His picture is in classrooms
His face is too long


We are all hobos
Some of us live in boxcars
Some of us do not


In the Grape Day Park
Hobos under every tree
One strums a guitar


Yay for the hobos
Yay Yay happy yay happy
Hobos are happy


Flay all the hobos
Flay all the hobos alive
Their hides are so thick


From the recluses  cell
the sweeat sparrows twitterings haunt
meditaiton fled


The poor man is like
a planet and his desires
Revolving satllites


My floor is quite flat
looks asthough a vast expanc
i hate soft drink stains


Sean is coolsort of
He has lots more friends than Bron
She is friendlessha


Oh skatepark my foe
Your concrete curves provide pain
Oh skatepark I cry


Cody writes a lot
of haikus and deserves to
get an award yeah


Mary Poppins is
here at Bear Valley Middle
School and is very


If I could sail far
far away stone vegitate
I would happily


The trees have the mist
Smoke fire two bodies one act
I but half a heart


The path to Heaven
is paved with spikes and thorns but
reaching is divine


the waters slip away
what we put off for tomorrow
must now become today


Others simply walk
You move like silk in warm air
I you beauty dwells


cranes dance on silk
lotus flowers on still pond
mothers kimono


Evanescent dream
Disintegrating castle
No longer supreme


Mornings are mornings
Timeless in my tiny world
My Earth azure joy


Ah Summer Breeze Ah
She loves to make us warm
Ah Summer Breeze Ah


The grass is growing
Or I am dwindling low
But the world wont stop


It was raining out
As I looked out the door
Then I heard thunder


i love cars so much
they can go fast like lambos
and burn rubber too


I am a cool guy
I think that peoples are random
Yay to the me Yeah


not as like before
why the sudden change in wind
questioning the fall


Brisk as times pace
Wondering who I am now
not who I once was


The shimmering mist
On the clear smooth glass
A breath in and out


The mouse eating seed
the black cat in the grasses
Life at a standstill


The pregnant lady
stared at her mans member and
remarked that looks fake


Bright white snow and ice
Biting bone chilling cold wind
I made hot kale soup

soundless low gray sky
air spiced with applewood smoke
fall will end tonight


atop peak all down
within valley all are up
hillside path variety


in battle with fall
winter coldly sneaks by
defeat is chilling


neighbors shoot their coyotes
mine eat the mice and gophers
mine must be better


Some think horrific
On the ground white all around
I say terrific


play table sitters
like an old mans erection
sad and yet funny


Rainy afternoon
Black dog shivers at the door
Throws in the towel


Rhododendronbush
Each bud saved her flower
for this sunny spring


Colorful fall leaves fall
Blowing in the pretty
Calming and soothing


Sarah likes to hack
computers every morning
in athe classrooms


Captain Mot has a
hot which he likes to wear a
lot during school days


Attempted Haiku
May seem contrived or may not
How about this one


oak tree bare roots up
lies broken across my path
rotting back to earth


ominous fingers
point from autumns morning sky
heaven beckons us


i have a stick
i have a woody
where is my cactus


balls
need licking
like felt


fountain pen gliding
across silky white vellum
thoughts actualize


He stuck in his thumb
and made her cum She was not
loud But cum she did


He wonders is it
acceptable It might be
controversial Sigh


Kittens circling
while mother searches for milk
here comes there owner


Swallowing the bait
Catfish hooked on ten pound test
No dinner tonight


Honeybees browsing
On the flowering hostas
Even in this heat


Oceans of light spill
like rice wine from lips which have
kissed the rising sun


Ants on a picnic
I told you this would happen
You never listen


Rocky Mountains rise
against a clear western sky
where the eagle flies


The stars in the sky
Twinkle so bright in my eye
Looking up at me


death a mystery
never comesnever wanted
just a a menace


Lonely mountain
Gazing below
At fertile valleys


The time here is brief
Chamber music fills the hall
When Peace rules the dawn


Outside my window
It is raining all is wet
But not my spirit


Bathing boys
Water cools
Hot tap on and on


A great cement lion
Guards my front door
I sneak out the back


A pond
Frog jumps in
I follow


I have a stick
Your eyes are brown
Hello Carpet


existential
universal explored
quantified boredom


Snowflakes pirouette
scrabble cold alphabet soup
from a haiku sky


Something tiny
boldly swimming shore to shore
in my water glass


On the lonely moors
The wind cuts into your face
Stranded far from home


a tree in twilight
I follow the sound of birds
to their silhouettes


Searchlights scissor sky
Siren hurds us down the tube
Drowning under dricks


Brown eyes black coffee
I woke up early today
And it was snowing


Indian Summer
Navajo blanket fading
with the fallen leaves


Inside the mirror
an onion peeling itself
over and over


Natural Beauty
Ever changing hills and dunes
Cold ruthless killer


Somethings gathering
The animals are long gone
Thunder is roaring


It sways all alone
Nature gave it its place here
We take it from it


Outside something brews
The wind is strong the airs cold
Nature is acting


Green towering trees
Meadows with green green grass
Perfect spot to rest


Lying jerk he is
Acts all sweet and innocent
well what should i do


Sick of this torture
feel so unhappy today
I wrote a haiku


Horizon moving
Only when you do constant
Ruler of the sky


Five seven and five
This seventeen syllables
caught in a pom


Looking at nature
seeing struggle and splendour
a nw thought was caught


I know many words
but I may not speak them here
at grandfathers grave


Oregon sun sets late
Three sisters sit so lonely
Pale moon draws anear


Birds just want to be
Free as their wings let them be
Cages cause them pain


One day we will die
What then is the need to kill
Still we go to War


My World Once So dark
Light Has Become Mute Like Pitch
Impenetrable


Tiger in the grass
My baby boy
Tickled nose


Morning sun
Rangitoto looms
Alive at last


Winter sun
Warm woolen back
Cloud cools


gray steamy morning
soft voice of falling rain
rose petals shudder


MY heart thumps
and my eyes stare into the distance
The loud sound Its over in a flash


Its fragile grip lost
a leaf drifts gently to earth
winter calls us home


dark clouds rolling in
consume the sun with their wrath
hotdogs on the grill


Moving reflections
of clouds upon the water
blurred from Gods tears


Summer nights air
Both my mind and cigar smoke
Drifting


In a show of power
I take from my sister
Happiness


A grasshopper on
My hand Pretending
to be a leaf


Shopping all day
No more at ease
Than before


Heart beats patiently
I wait quietly for my love
Do I wait in vain


I dont why life
Has to be so Rough
So confusing


Love is what you give
fragrant flower in the wind
the shade of a tree


Once upon a time
how original that was
where was I again


misshapen ugly
hiking boots just the right look
to go with my brace


overturned earth for
the new gardenbirds dive in
for the harvest


Dont step on the cracks
In the butterfly garden
Oops  One insect less


My Cuban lover
twirls the knit scarf from her neck
and she is naked


Droplets cling to glass
As if suspended in air
Spring pitterpatter


Sleep brings needed calm
After a long day of work
Close your eyes and dream


fresh rabbit road kill
steaming in the tule fog
unseen crows chuckle


Brown crosses my mind
as i flush the white toilet
the thoughts go away


Flowers are dark red
They smell like the deep brown stuff
They taste like poopy


Rain is falling down
The leaves are green and orange
I am wet and cold


pokemon are great
They always catch the poke bait
Gotta Catch em all


The birds are chirping
I love the mud under my feet
Leaves are returning


The leaves have fallen
the wind just sweeps them away
therefore kids can play


dip drop bang boom flash
the rain thunder and lighting
feel hear see the storm


drip drop bang boom flash
the rain thunder and lighting
feel hear see the storm


Something is coming
Its going crack boom bang
OMG its a S T O R M


Dog chases mouse needing food
Ends up with a house with Mouse
Under never having mouse dinner


A tiger in Africa
Hunting a gazelle
In plane site


walking through the woods
I hear click crash trees falling
waited a second


I love the sound of hocking
Like the movie meet the fockers
the men honk when theyre horny


Hobos are stupid
The often life on the streets
They dont own nutting


The snow is coming down hard
Ooo please pleaseplease
Yes No school today


Rain in the distance
Blackout in the large city
The storm is strong

perfect eye exam
God in His compassion knows
already deaf


my favorite shade
of green in fashion again
spring


Snakes are eating mice
They are very mean today
I think one saw me


People have good things
Some people just smell nasTY
and people are gross


I wish for someone
to remove pretend haiku
go back to honor


Fog comes on little cat feet
It sits looking over harbor
on silent haunches


One window is all I need to see
The icy trees
After it just stormed


The hawk spreads their wings
Flying high up while I watch
And envy their luck


Death is a wonder
It never comes as a guest
But as a beggar


The wind doesnt stop
cold is the little turtle
he has no blanket


Thunderstorms are
Like a random loud boo but
Then theres a flash after


He is a cheating brat
He is cheated on my bestfriend
Wow he is a jerk


Fresh cut hair itches
A reminder of my loss
I weep for the past


Winter brings cold pain
These joints creak and crack and pop
When did I get old


These words are crafty
They have stolen precious time
that you cant get back


Inconceivable
You keep on using this word
You misunderstand


Red lights running down
The street and past the pine tree
Where has the moon gone
